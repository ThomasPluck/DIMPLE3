        "# DIMPLE3 Simulation\n",
        "\n",
        "DIMPLE3 is the Euler's method extension of the ordinary DIMPLE system which aims to solve three major problems with DIMPLE:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Exponential space requirment in coupling precision\n",
        "2. Underutilization of quadratic space in number of spins\n",
        "3. Suboptimal convergence from deterministic dynamics\n",
        "\n",
        "To this end, we propose an architecture which extends the buffer-chain DIMPLE hardware with three corresponding improvements:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Replace coupling cell rows with single spin counters\n",
        "2. Allow for comparison between these counters via a barrel shifter\n",
        "3. Add back to spin counters with appropriate coupling weight and noise\n",
        "\n",
        "The following is an event driven simulation of the proposed architecture with which to benchmark any FPGA implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Presents with the following advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Euler simulation requires O(N) clock cycles for N spins\n",
        "- Lin-Log Space allows for simple Trotterization via replication\n",
        "- Multiple instances of circuit only require one copy of memory to be shared\n",
        "\n",
        "Has the following disadvantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Comparison is expensive especially through a barrel-shifter, requiring a very high constant multiplier on the theoretical big-O lin-log term or approximation heuristics."
